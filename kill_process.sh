Kill Process

Bash Script to kill a process running on specific port. Yes, you'll need it to stop non-standard servers for instance django server, app engine server etc 
where you can't use something like "sudo service apache stop".
Usually, you would first get the pid of the process/server running on a specific port using maybe "netstat", then you use the "kill" cmd to stop the process
running that pid. That's long stuff.
